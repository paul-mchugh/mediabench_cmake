To build RSAREF, copy the makefile for your operating system from the
'install' subdirectory to the 'test' subdirectory. Then run your
operating system's 'make' program from the 'test' subdirectory. The
makefile will compile the RSAREF source code and build the
demonstration program. Makefiles are found in subdirectories of the
'install' subdirectory:

     dos       Personal Computer running DOS, Microsoft C v6.00a
     mac       Macintosh running System 7, MPW 3.2
     unix      NeXTStation, DECStation 3100, SPARCStation 1
     vax       MicroVAX II running VMS

For example, suppose you are running DOS with Microsoft's NMAKE
utility. From the 'test' directory you would run the commands:

     copy ..\install\dos\makefile
     nmake

# Sample config.txt file for PGP 2.6.2.

# MyName is substring of default user ID for secret key to make signatures.
# If not set, PGP will use the first key on your secret keyring (the last
# key you created) if you don't specify the user with -u
# MyName = "John Q. Public"

# The language we will be using for displaying messages to the user.  
#
# Available languages:
#   en = English (default), es = Spanish, fr = French, 
#   de = German, it = Italian, br = Brazilian portuguese
#
# Languages not yet available:
#   esp = Esperanto, lv = Latvian, lt3 = Lithuanian,
#   ru = Russian, nl = Dutch, #   fi = Finnish,
#   hu = Hungarian, no = Norwegian, pt = Portugese,
#   sv = Swedish, da = Danish, is = Icelandic,
#   zh = Chinese, ko = Korean, ar = Arabic, iw = Hebrew,

# Character set for displaying messages and for conversion of text files.
# If you set this variable to cp850, ascii or alt_codes, PGP will do
# character set conversions if TextMode = on or if you specify the -t
# option when encrypting or signing a file.
# 
# Available character sets:
#   latin1, cp850, alt_codes, koi8, ascii
#
# For MSDOS with a standard character set you should use cp850 to get
# correct character translations.  Russian character sets for MSDOS are
# usually alt_codes.
#
# The default for CharSet is "noconv" which means no character conversion.
# Note that noconv, latin1, and koi8 are all treated as equivalent.
#
# CharSet = cp850

# TMP is the directory name for PGP scratch files, usually a RAM disk.
# TMP = "e:\"     # Can be overridden by environment variable TMP

# Pager is the file viewing program used for viewing messages with -m
# If not set or set to "pgp", a built-in pager will be used.  The pager set
# in config.txt will override the environment variable PAGER.
# Pager = "list"

# ArmorLines is the maximum number of lines per packet when creating a
# transport armored file.  Set to 0 to disable splitting in parts.
Armorlines = 720

# The following commented-out settings are *not* the defaults.
# Uncomment (remove the leading "#" character) them to get the
# non-default behaviour indicated.

# Armor = on          # Use -a flag for ASCII armor whenever applicable
# TextMode = on       # Attempt to use -t option where applicable
clearsig = on       # Use unarmored plaintext for unencrypted signed message
# KeepBinary = on     # Decrypt will not delete intermediate .pgp file
# verbose = 2         # verbose diagnostic messages
# verbose = 0         # be quiet
# compress = off      # off means suppress compression to aid debugging
# showpass = on       # Echo password when user types it


# BakRing is the path to a backup copy of your secret keyring, usually
# on floppy disk.  Your secret keys will be compared with the backup copy
# when doing a keyring check (pgp -kc)

# TZFix is hours to add to time() to get GMT, for GMT timestamps.
# Since MSDOS assumes local time is US Pacific time, and pre-corrects 
# Pacific time to GMT, make TZFix=0 for California, -1 for Colorado, 
# -2 for Chicago, -3 for NY, -8 for London, -9 for Amsterdam.  
# However, if your MSDOS environmental variable TZ is properly defined 
# for your timezone, you can leave TZFix=0.  Unix systems probably 
# shouldn't need to worry about setting TZFix.
# TZFix = 0

Description:
	This directory contains the necessary files to build PGP 2.6 source
	under VMS.

	Usage is generally:
		1) Unpack your PGP 2.6 Sources including the files
			in [.PGP26]
		2) Set default to [.PGP26.VMSBUILD] and perform:
		   @ALLBUILD

Operation:
	The distribution directory tree [relevant] structure is:
	[.pgp26]
		[.src]
			!PGP2.6 sources
			pgp.c			!etc.
			...
		[.vmsbuild]
			!VMS Build files
			000read.me
			allbuild.com			!Calls builds and link
			rsabuild.com			!Build proc for RSAREFLIB
			pgpbuild.com			!Build proc for PGP sources
			pgplink.com			!Linker proc for PGP 2.6
		...
	
	        [.rsaref]
		        [.source]
			     !RSAREF sources
			     desc.c
			     ...
		...


	The RSABUILD.COM and PGPBUILD.COM structures DEPEND on this relative
	layout of the source directories.  If your layout is different, the
	provided build procedures WILL NOT WORK.  You will have to modify
	them to match your directory layout.

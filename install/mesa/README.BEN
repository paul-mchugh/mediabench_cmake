Generates libraries but exec is empty. No additional docs.
Should probably check with author about what to run.

Go into the demos directory and build the three programs mipmap, osdemo,
and texgen.  That's the mesa benchmark.  It should really have an exec
file, though.

To compile: make gcc in root dir. then make gcc in demos.

To run: cd to exec. execute ./run. output is produced in out?.ppm

EPIC (Efficient Pyramid Image Coder) is an experimental image data compression
utility written in the C programming language.  The compression algorithms are
based on a biorthogonal critically-sampled dyadic wavelet decomposition and a
combined run-length/Huffman entropy coder.  The filters have been designed to
allow extremely fast decoding on conventional (ie, non-floating point) hardware,
at the expense of slower encoding and a slight degradation in compression
quality (as compared to a good orthogonal wavelet decomposition).

We are making this code available to interested researchers who wish to
experiment with a subband pyramid coder.  We have attempted to optimize the
speed of pyramid reconstruction, but the code has not been otherwise optimized,
either for speed or compression quality.  In particular, the pyramid
construction process is unnecessarily slow, quantization binsizes are chosen to
be the same for each subband, and we have used a very simple scalar entropy
coding scheme to compress the quantized subbands.  Although this coding
technique provides good coding performance, a more sophisticated coding scheme
(e.g., utilizing an arithmetic coder, or a vector quantizer) combined with this
pyramid decomposition could result in substantial coding gains.  EPIC is
currently limited to 8-bit monochrome images, and does not explicitly provide 
a progressive transmission capability.

EPIC is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.cis.upenn.edu (IP number
158.130.12.3) in the file pub/eero/epic.tar.Z.  This is a
unix-compressed tarfile: don't forget to put ftp into BINARY mode.

====================
README --  By C. Lee
====================
This directory contains modified source files. Modifications
had been made to facilitate dinero and spix simulations. The
original program expects an input stream from stdin and 
produces an output stream to stdout. Since we need to pipe 
memory addresses referenced by the program execution to the
dinero cache simulator. Also in case that a shell does not allow
to specify the file descriptor 3 to which the signature (execution
characteristics) of a instrumented program has to be redirected
(i.e., "3>"), the output of the program cannot be directed to
stdout. In such cases, use source files in this directory instead 
of ones in src subdirectory.
